        <p>OWLDiff is a project aiming to substitute classical diff used in version control systems, when such system is
            used for keeping ontologies. Naturally OWLDiff can be used as stand-alone application, too.</p>

        <p>It supports ontologies in language OWL 1.1 (standardized by W3C) stored as XML files.</p>

        <p>The application loads two ontologies specified in command-line arguments, or user can choose them after
            starting the application using open dialogs. The main window show trees of both loaded ontologies, showing
            only axioms that differ between the ontologies. Different colors highlight axioms in one ontology which can
            be inferred from the other and axioms which are present in one ontology and not the other.</p>

        <p>Optional analysis of difference can be performed using CEX algorithm (Boris Konev, Dirk Walther, and Frank
            Wolter, see <a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/publ/publ.html">http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/publ/publ.html</a>).It
            only supports description logic <span class="cal">EL</span>, but it can find differences that the basic
            method cannot. However, the results are two lists of classes (DiffL and DiffR, for details see the paper in
            the link above), not axioms.</p>
