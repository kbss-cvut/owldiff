<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
    OWLdiff is a project for comparing and merging of two ongologies. It aims to help managing and updating ontologies,
    which are often modified by several sides, and merging of concurrent updates is necessary.
    Usually, as for case of textual source codes, a versioning system is used for similar purpose: when multiple people
    update the same file, one of them performs a merge, using a <tt>diff</tt> utility,
    which allows him to view the changes in the file, select the changes which are to be included in the result, merge
    the files, and commit the resulting file.
</p>

<p>
    OWLdiff serves the same purpose for ontologies, as <tt>diff</tt> does for textual files. It takes two ontologies as
    arguments; let us call them the <q>original</q> and the <q>update.</q>
    Then it uses the Pellet reasoner to check, if the two ontologies are semantically equivalent. If not, it shows the
    differences graphically in two trees, one for each ontology. User can select
    differing items in either tree, which is to be updated in the resulting merged ontology.
</p>

<h1>Installation - Standalone</h1>

<h2>How to setup the development environment</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download and install Maven (http://maven.apache.org/). <br/>
        NOTE: Ensure that You have internet connection for the initial setup and that you have set proxy (if
        applicable).
        There will be a significant network traffic when downloading all necessary libraries and plugins for Maven for
        the first time setup.
    </li>

    <li>Run the 'install-local-files'. (On Windows machines, rename it to .bat first). This will add local dependencies
        to the Maven local repository.
    </li>
    <li>Go to the 'owldiff-core' directory and run 'mvn install'. This compiles and installs the OWLDiff core part -
        that is used by the other OWLDiff projects.
    </li>
    <li>Go back to the 'owldiff' dir and now You can generate project files for Your favorite development environment:
        <br/>
        'mvn eclipse:eclipse' (For Neon Plugin you will need to perform this command also in the plugin directory to
        preserver the dependencies) <br/>
        'mvn idea:idea' <br/>
        For NetBeans there should be a direct support in the 6.5 version. For earlier versions try MevenIDE
        (http://mevenide.codehaus.org/) .
    </li>
    <li>You can start Your IDE and start coding :-) :
        <ul>
            <li>for developing standalone application you will need to open owldiff-core and owldiff-standalone projects
                in your favorite IDE
            </li>
            <li>for developing neon plugin you will need to open owldiff-core and owldiff-neon-plugin projects in
                Eclipse
            </li>
            <li>for developing protege plugin you will need to open owldiff-core and owldiff-protege-plugin projects in
                Eclipse
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: For project lifecycle management You can use maven directly for command-line. The only exceptions are</p>
<ol>
    <li>the owldiff-neon-plugin project, as it requires Eclipse libraries (not attached through Maven, meanwhile)</li>
    <li>the owldiff project as it has the owldiff-neon-plugin as its module.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: Please read all readme.txt for nested projects for other configuration setups.</p>

<p>
    The Maven setup is just an experiment - its benefits are not clear by now. Anyway the directory 'lib-old' is NOT
    SUPPOSED to be used during the development stage.
    It is left in the repository as a backup - all required libraries should be loaded through Maven as described above.
</p>

<h1>User Guide</h1>
<!--hr /-->
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    This user guide describes the usage of the main features of OWLdiff.
</p>

<h2>startup</h2>

<p>
    The OWLDiff is started with two parameters, which are locations of ontologies to be compared.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <i>java -jar swutils.jar [ontology-old.owl] [ontology-update.owl]</i>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After the program starts, the <i>diff</i> algorithm is performed and window, showing the differences, is opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="images/main.png" alt="Overview of the main screen"/>
    <br/>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Left pane - Overview of axioms of the old ontology.</li>
    <li>Right pane - Overview of axioms of the new ontology.</li>
    <li>Main menu - here you can adjust type of view, switch off reasoner and select different ontologies</li>
    <li><b>Select all/Deselect All</b> - allows you to select/deselect all axioms, which are different</li>
    <li>Merge - performs merge on loaded ontologies with respect to selected axioms to be deleted/removed
        CEX - Shows differences based on results of the <i>CEX</i> algorithm.
    </li>
    <li>Axiom properties - shows the role of each axioms
        <ol>
            <li>Inferred - this axioms is not presented in the ontology, but can be inferred. The axioms, which were
                used for inferring are shown.
            </li>
            <li>Axiom is in both ontologies</li>
            <li>Axiom has no connection to other ontology</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>settings</h2>

<p>
    In the settings, you can select the different representation of axioms or switch off <i>Pellet</i> reasoner.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Show common axioms - If selected, all axioms from the ontology are shown(even the common axioms)</li>
    <li>Show class hierarchy - If selected, classes/properties are organised based on subclass axioms</li>
    <li>Use pellet classification - If selected, the <i>Pellet</i> reasoner is used for finding differential axioms. It
        leads to less(or equal) set of differential axioms, because some of the axioms can be inferred even if not
        presented in the ontology.
    </li>
    <li>Manchester syntax - axioms are shown in more human-readable <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/ManchesterSyntax">Manchester syntax</a></li>
    <li>Description logic - classical description logic syntax <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic">more
        ...</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>selecting axioms</h2>

<p>
    Axioms for merge can be selected by highlighting each axiom with double-click, or by clicking on select/deselect all
    axioms button above each ontology view.
    <br/>
    Selecting axioms in original and update ontology has different meaning:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Original - Axioms selected here will be removed from the ontology(assuming they should be removed, because they
        are not contained in the update)
    </li>
    <li>Update - These axioms are to be added to the merged ontology</li>
</ol>

<h2>merge</h2>

<p>
    By clicking the <i>merge</i> button, a window showing the operations to be performed is opened.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="images/merge.png" alt="Merge window"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the left pane, there are axioms to be deleted from the original ontology and in the right pane, there are axioms,
    which will be added from update ontology.
    <br/>
    By default, the merged ontology is saved to the location of the original ontology(assuming we performed update to
    that one) and the <b>original ontology is lost</b>. By clicking the <i>change</i> button, the location of the
    resulting ontology can be changed to merge into another file.
    <br/>
    After clicking <i>OK</i> button, the new ontology is created from the common axioms and the axioms selected from the
    update ontology and saved to the specified file.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After merging the ontology, new <i>diff</i> is performed on the selected files to show if there are any remaining
    differences in the ontologies.
</p>


<a id="algorithms" name="algorithms"></a>

<h1>Algorithms</h1>

<p>
    The system incorporates two algorithms described in following chapters to find differences between two ontologies.
    The first one is a simple way how to find missing, added or modified axioms,
    but cannot reveal complex dependencies. The other, CEX, is more complicated, can find deep impacts of modified
    axioms (differences that cannot be seen in class hierarchies),
    but supports only <img alt="EL" src="images/el.png"/> description logics.
</p>

<h2>Basic Ontology Comparison</h2>

<p>
    This algorithm compares only axioms. It generates 4 axiom lists, to represent a few types of ontology differences:
    <em>origRest</em>, <em>updateRest</em>, <em>inferred</em>, <em>possiblyRemove</em>.
    The process is divided into two steps.
</p>

<p>
    The first step is the syntactic diff. The algoritm first adds all the axioms contained in the <q>update</q> ontology
    but not in the <q>original</q> ontology into the <em>updateRest</em> list,
    then the axioms contained in the <q>original</q> ontology but not in the <q>update</q> ontology into the <em>origRest</em>
    list.
</p>

<p>
    The other step is based upon entailments. It uses the lists <em>origRest</em> and <em>updateRest</em> from the
    previous step. It takes all axioms from the <em>updateRest</em> list, and checks
    if the axioms can be entailed from the <q>original</q> ontology; if yes, it puts them into the
    <em>possiblyRemove</em> list - list of axioms, that may be redundant in the <q>update</q> ontology
    (with respect to <q>original</q> ontology).
    Then it takes all axioms from the <em>origRest</em> list, and checks if the axioms can be entailed from the <q>update</q>
    ontology; if yes, it puts them into the <em>inferred</em> list
    - list of axioms, that are covered by the <q>update</q> ontology, and thus are not lost when omitted.
</p>

<h2>CEX: Logical Diff</h2>

<p>
    This is a more complicated algorithm, finding complex effects of axiom modifications, but only able to work on <img
        alt="EL" src="images/el.png"/> description logics. It is based on the paper:
    Konev, B., Walther, D., and Wolter, F.: <em>The logical difference problem for description logic terminologies</em>,
    online at
    <a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/publ/publ.html">http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frank/publ/publ.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The <img alt="EL" src="images/el.png"/> description logics allows following constructs:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Concept <img alt="concept definition" src="images/cor.png"/></li>
    <li>Axioms: concept inclusion <img alt="C sub D" src="images/csubd.png"/>, concept equality <img alt="C eq D"
                                                                                                     src="images/ceqd.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>No concept name can occur on the left side of an axiom more than once</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The algorithm uses a signature <img alt="sigma" src="images/sigma.png"/>, which is an union of a set of concept and
    a set of roles.
</p>


<p>
    The algorithm returns in polynomial time two sets of concepts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><img alt="diffR" src="images/diffr.png"/></li>
    <li><img alt="diffL" src="images/diffl.png"/></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The two sets represent differences between two ontologies, even when the differences cannot be observed in class
    hierarchies.
    The algorithm uses various auxiliary sets, and is rather complicated; it is beyond scope of this document, for
    details please see the paper <em>Kovev et al.</em>
</p>

<p>
    Following image shows how a sample output of CEX algorithm looks like. This is is an example used in the paper <em>Kovev
    et al.</em>, giving the same results as in the paper.
